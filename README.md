USB STEALER TELEGRAM 📦📨

> ## Information🔍 ##
I've created a python program consisting of three scripts to send all the data on a USB flash drive in a zip file to telegram. 

>The first script is usb.py, which will detect the insertion of a USB flash drive and send it to Windows as a zip file. Thanks to : @bestmahdi2 https://github.com/bestmahdi2/FileStealerUSB2PC/blob/master/FileStealerUSB2PC.py
